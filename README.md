# Summer Project

## Using Machine learning for ‘premise selection’ in the Lean theorem prover

## Part 1:
Learing Lean programming language for formal verification of mathematical proofs.

## Part 2:
Using the theorems already proved in the lean's libraries as data set to create Deep Learning models for predecting the terms (reasoning) used in the proof of a given types (statement).
